Data Storage & Querying: SQL (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server)

Visualization & Reporting: Power BI Desktop

Data Sources: Loan datasets (CSV, Excel, or database formats)

Project Overview

Data Ingestion & Cleaning

Loaded raw loan data into a relational database system.

Cleaned and prepped dataset—handled missing values, formatted data types, and standardized fields.

SQL-Based Analysis

Created queries to compute metrics such as:

Loan status breakdown (approved vs. rejected)

Distribution by loan amount and duration

Average interest rates over time

Performance by demographic attributes (e.g., region, employment status)

Power BI Dashboard

Built interactive visuals including bar charts, slicers, and drill-downs.

Enabled dynamic filtering by categories like loan amount, status, and customer segments.

Insights & Findings

Highlighted trends like seasonal fluctuations in approvals, high-risk loan segments, and performance gaps across customer profiles.

Potential applications: credit risk assessment, portfolio optimization, and targeted product adjustments.
